This article determines the composition of functions $f \circ f\left( \right)$, where $f\left( x \right) = 3x - 1$.

12
00:04:23,599 --> 00:05:29,666
The process involves replacing the value $f\left( x \right)$ within the function $f\left( x \right)$.

\section{Introduction}

14
00:05:52,399 --> 00:06:56,399
In this article, we will calculate the composition of the function $f\left( x \right)$ of $f\left( x \right)$.

15
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:53,366
The composition of functions, defined by $f\circ f\left( x \right)$, is obtained by applying the function $f$ to the result of the function $f\left( x \right)$.

00:07:53,366 --> 00:08:10,666
\section{Function Composition}

17
00:08:10,666 --> 00:09:41,399
Let the functions be $f\left( x \right) = 3x - 1$ and $g\left( x \right) = x^{2} + x - 1$.

18
00:09:41,399 --> 00:10:24,099
Let's determine $f \circ f\left( x \right)$:

19
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:34,133
\begin{align*} ... \end{align*}

20
00:10:34,133 --> 00:11:05,965
f \circ f\left( x \right)

21
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:45,099
&= f\left( f\left( x \right) \right) \\

22
00:11:45,099 --> 00:12:22,965
&= f\left( 3x - 1 \right) \\

23
00:12:22,965 --> 00:13:07,366
&= 3 \cdot \left( 3x - 1 \right) - 1 \\

24
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:27,366
&= 9x - 3 - 1 \\

25
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:38,765
&= 9x - 4 \\

26
00:13:38,765 --> 00:14:04,965
&= \boxed{9x - 4}

27
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:28,099
\section{Conclusion}

28
00:14:28,099 --> 00:15:22,699
We conclude that the composition of functions $f \circ f\left( x \right)$ is equal to $9x - 4$.
